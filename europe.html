        in London. The continent has played a major role in art, science, literature,
        and philosophy for centuries. Many famous artists, writers, and scientists like
        Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare, and Einstein came from Europe. The natural beauty 
        of Europe is also breathtaking, from the snowy Alps to the sunny beaches of Spain
        and Greece. Countries like Switzerland are famous for their mountains, while Norway 
        is known for its fjords. Paris is called the “City of Love” and attracts millions of
        tourists every year. Italy is famous for its ancient Roman history and delicious food
        like pizza and pasta. Germany is known for its castles, festivals, and modern industries.
        Spain is loved for its warm weather, beaches, and flamenco dance. Greece is famous for its
        ancient temples and islands. Europe is also home to the European Union, which unites many 
        countries together. With its mix of history, culture, and natural beauty, Europe is truly
