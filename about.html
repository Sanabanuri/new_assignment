    <p>I am currently learning programming, diving into the world of coding and software development. My journey started with the basics, such as understanding variables, data types, and control structures. I’m exploring different programming languages, focusing on Python for its versatility and ease of use. I aim to develop a strong foundation in problem-solving and logic, which will help me write efficient and clean code. As I progress, I’m learning how to work with libraries and frameworks to build more complex applications. My goal is to create both web and mobile apps, and eventually contribute to open-source projects. I also have an interest in algorithms and data structures to optimize code performance. The more I code, the more I appreciate the creativity and problem-solving aspect of programming. I’m excited to face challenges and keep improving with each project I take on. Ultimately, I want to build a career in tech and continue learning new concepts every day.</p>
